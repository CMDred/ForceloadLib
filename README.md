# ForceloadLib
A Minecraft Data Pack library that adds various useful features related to forceloading chunks.\
For inquiries, please contact **@silicatYT** on Discord.

## Features
- Reference based forceloading
  - Add and remove forceload references from a chunk
  - The chunk will only stop being forceloaded once every single reference has been removed
- Various optional parameters for your forceload references:
  - **Command:** Run a command at the specified location as soon as the chunk is loaded
  - **Force:** Make the reference unremovable until the chunk is loaded
  - **Protected:** Make the reference unremovable unless you target it directly via ID
  - **Duration:** Make the reference disappear after an arbitrary number of ticks
- Powerful reference management
  - Either remove the last removable reference from a chunk, or target it directly via ID
- Compatibility with Vanilla forceloaded chunks
  - These chunks will be ignored when trying to add/remove references
